The evolution generates plenty of different proteins, with unique abilities, but also proteins with related functions hence surface, which is therefore of primary importance for their activity. In the present work, we assess the ability of five methods to retrieve similar protein surfaces, using either their shape only (3D meshes), or their shape and the electrostatic potential at their surface, an important surface property. Five different groups participated in this challenge using the shape only, and one group extended its pre-existing algorithm to handle the electrostatic potential. The results reveal both the ability of the methods to detect related proteins and their difficulties to distinguish between topologically related proteins.","tags":null,"title":"SHREC 2021: Surface-based Protein Domains Retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Kinship verification aims at determining whether two facial images are from related people or not, while kinship retrieval is the task of retrieving possible related facial images to a person from a gallery of images. They introduce unique challenges because of the hidden relations and features that carry inherent characteristics between the facial images. We employ 3 methods, FaceNet, Siamese VGGFace, and a combination of FaceNet and VGG-Face models as feature extractors, to achieve the 9th standing for kinship verification and the 5th standing for kinship retrieval in the Recognizing Family in The Wild 2020 competition.

The goal of the contest is to assess the capability of different computational approaches to identify different conformations of the same protein, or the presence of common sub-parts, starting from a set of molecular surfaces. We addressed two problems: defining the similarity solely based on the surface geometry or with the inclusion of physicochemical information, such as electrostatic potential, amino acid hydrophobicity, and the presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors.

Computers, being it your laptop or smartphone, require significant attention from us to operate. Every time you look down to text on your phone screen is a moment you disengage from reality. This is due to the lack of intuitive and implicit input capabilities for computer and such minuscule but repetitive behavior have turned people to prefer keyboards and screens over talking and interacting with the physical world. Over the past decade, there have been significant efforts in addressing this challenge via brave new interactive modalities that could weave seamlessly into our life such as smart glasses, smart rings, smart speakers, etc.\nIn this thesis, we set forth to extend this line of research for intuitive, effortless, and enjoyable computer interaction by employing a natural everyday-carry object -- the smartwatch. We look for extending the capability of the smartwatch beyond what it already is, i.e., a timepiece and mostly a health monitor, and become a mean to facilitate an effortless human-computer away from mice and keyboards. We follow through, first by enhancing the capability of the smartwatch; then we propose a technique for activity recognition using inertial motion signals from the smartwatch; and finally, we implement a flexible authentication framework for multiple platforms authentication using wearable devices that are highly customizable.","tags":null,"title":"Towards a Gratifying Interactive Modality for Smart Environments based on Ubiquitous Sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

To address that, this paper investigates a method of generalization through adversarial data augmentation.
