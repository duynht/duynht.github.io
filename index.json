We introduce in this paper the Bayesian recourse, a model-agnostic recourse that minimizes the posterior probability odds ratio. Further, we present its min-max robust counterpart with the goal of hedging against future changes in the machine learning model parameters. The robust counterpart explicitly takes into account possible perturbations of the data in a Gaussian mixture ambiguity set prescribed using the optimal transport (Wasserstein) distance. We show that the resulting worst-case objective function can be decomposed into solving a series of two-dimensional optimization subproblems, and the min-max recourse finding problem is thus amenable to a gradient descent algorithm. Contrary to existing methods for generating robust recourses, the robust Bayesian recourse does not require a linear approximation step. The numerical experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed robust Bayesian recourse facing model shifts.

Computers, being it your laptop or smartphone, require significant attention from us to operate. Every time you look down to text on your phone screen is a moment you disengage from reality. This is due to the lack of intuitive and implicit input capabilities for computer and such minuscule but repetitive behavior have turned people to prefer keyboards and screens over talking and interacting with the physical world. Over the past decade, there have been significant efforts in addressing this challenge via brave new interactive modalities that could weave seamlessly into our life such as smart glasses, smart rings, smart speakers, etc.\nIn this thesis, we set forth to extend this line of research for intuitive, effortless, and enjoyable computer interaction by employing a natural everyday-carry object -- the smartwatch. We look for extending the capability of the smartwatch beyond what it already is, i.e., a timepiece and mostly a health monitor, and become a mean to facilitate an effortless human-computer away from mice and keyboards. We follow through, first by enhancing the capability of the smartwatch; then we propose a technique for activity recognition using inertial motion signals from the smartwatch; and finally, we implement a flexible authentication framework for multiple platforms authentication using wearable devices that are highly customizable.","tags":null,"title":"Towards a Gratifying Interactive Modality for Smart Environments based on Ubiquitous Sensing (BSc.
