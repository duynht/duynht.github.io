The goal of the contest is to assess the capability of different computational approaches to identify different conformations of the same protein, or the presence of common sub-parts, starting from a set of molecular surfaces. We addressed two problems: defining the similarity solely based on the surface geometry or with the inclusion of physicochemical information, such as electrostatic potential, amino acid hydrophobicity, and the presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. Retrieval and classification performances, with respect to the single protein or the existence of common sub-sequences, are analysed according to a number of information retrieval indicators","tags":null,"title":"SHREC 2021: Retrieval and classification of protein surfaces equipped with physical and chemical properties","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This paper assesses the ability of five methods to retrieve similar protein surfaces, using either their shape only (3D meshes), or their shape and the electrostatic potential at their surface, an important surface property.\n","date":1630540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630540800,"objectID":"8a7bc751fefcbe2ea543746702a43ba5","permalink":"https://duynht.github.io/publication/protein_domains/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/protein_domains/","section":"publication","summary":"Proteins are essential to nearly all cellular mechanism, and often interact through their surface with other cell molecules, such as proteins and ligands. The evolution generates plenty of different proteins, with unique abilities, but also proteins with related functions hence surface, which is therefore of primary importance for their activity. In the present work, we assess the ability of five methods to retrieve similar protein surfaces, using either their shape only (3D meshes), or their shape and the electrostatic potential at their surface, an important surface property. Five different groups participated in this challenge using the shape only, and one group extended its pre-existing algorithm to handle the electrostatic potential. The results reveal both the ability of the methods to detect related proteins and their difficulties to distinguish between topologically related proteins.","tags":null,"title":"SHREC 2021: Surface-based Protein Domains Retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this thesis, we set forth to extend this line of research for intuitive, effortless, and enjoyable computer interaction by employing a natural everyday-carry object \u0026ndash; the smartwatch.\n","date":1630108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630108800,"objectID":"24e5d6efbadc97f968f3a8748895a3ed","permalink":"https://duynht.github.io/publication/accel_watch/","publishdate":"2021-08-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/accel_watch/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite computers are created to serve humans and come for their needs, interaction with computers nowadays is an obstruction to our societal life. Computers, being it your laptop or smartphone, require significant attention from us to operate. Every time you look down to text on your phone screen is a moment you disengage from reality. This is due to the lack of intuitive and implicit input capabilities for computer and such minuscule but repetitive behavior have turned people to prefer keyboards and screens over talking and interacting with the physical world. Over the past decade, there have been significant efforts in addressing this challenge via brave new interactive modalities that could weave seamlessly into our life such as smart glasses, smart rings, smart speakers, etc.\nIn this thesis, we set forth to extend this line of research for intuitive, effortless, and enjoyable computer interaction by employing a natural everyday-carry object -- the smartwatch. We look for extending the capability of the smartwatch beyond what it already is, i.e., a timepiece and mostly a health monitor, and become a mean to facilitate an effortless human-computer away from mice and keyboards. We follow through, first by enhancing the capability of the smartwatch; then we propose a technique for activity recognition using inertial motion signals from the smartwatch; and finally, we implement a flexible authentication framework for multiple platforms authentication using wearable devices that are highly customizable.","tags":null,"title":"Towards a Gratifying Interactive Modality for Smart Environments based on Ubiquitous Sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We propose three multi-modal methods for mapping text and images of news articles to the shared space in order to perform efficient cross-retrieval.\n","date":1607904000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607904000,"objectID":"1e3df8cdf32aeed6550f08a85a1c2af8","permalink":"https://duynht.github.io/publication/image_text/","publishdate":"2020-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/image_text/","section":"publication","summary":"Matching text and images based on their semantics has an important role in cross-media retrieval.
